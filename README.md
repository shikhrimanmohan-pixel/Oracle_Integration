# Oracle Integration - Chainlink External Data
<img width="942" height="551" alt="{53342FD9-C4F1-4AA2-9FBD-ECE178A7D23B}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad17cfbf-be6c-48f7-b94d-fb7d480d6819" />

## Project Description

This smart contract project demonstrates the integration of Chainlink oracles to fetch real-world external data on the blockchain. The `OracleIntegration.sol` contract serves as a decentralized price feed aggregator that can retrieve, store, and manage cryptocurrency price data from multiple Chainlink price feed oracles.

The contract acts as a middleware layer between decentralized applications (dApps) and Chainlink's decentralized oracle network, providing reliable and tamper-proof external data access for various blockchain applications.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly oracle integration system that:

- **Democratizes Access**: Makes external data accessible to any smart contract or dApp
- **Ensures Reliability**: Leverages Chainlink's proven oracle infrastructure for data integrity
- **Promotes Interoperability**: Provides a standardized interface for multiple data sources
- **Enables Innovation**: Empowers developers to build data-driven blockchain applications
- **Maintains Decentralization**: Preserves the trustless nature of blockchain while accessing external data

## Key Features

### üîç **Real-time Price Feeds**

- Handle different decimal precisions automatically
- Standardized price formatting across all assets

### üîÑ **Event-Driven Updates**
- Comprehensive event emission for price updates
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Integration-friendly event structure

## Core Functions

### 1. **getLatestPrice(string symbol)**
- Retrieves the most recent price data for a given asset
- Returns price, decimals, and timestamp information
- Direct integration with Chainlink price feeds

### 2. **updatePrice(string symbol)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Chainlink contracts library
- Web3 development environment (Hardhat/Foundry)

### Installation
```bash
npm install @chainlink/contracts
```

### Deployment
Deploy to your preferred network with the appropriate Chainlink price feed addresses for that network.

### Usage
```solidity
// Get ETH price
(int256 price, uint8 decimals, uint256 timestamp) = oracle.getLatestPrice("ETH");

// Update BTC price
oracle.updatePrice("BTC");

// Add new price feed
oracle.addPriceFeed("MATIC", 0x7bAC85A8a13A4BcD8abb3eB7d6b4d632c5a57676);
```
